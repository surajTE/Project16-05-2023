                            While pursuing my master's degree in Product Service System Design (PSSD) at Politecnico di
                            Milano, I was exposed to a
                            variety of projects that showcased the vast potential of this discipline. Through these
                            experiences, I honed my ability
                            to implement quantitative and qualitative design research methods, which played a crucial
                            role in guiding my design
                            decisions.

                            This innovative approach helped me harness my innate curiosity, allowing me to delve deeper
                            into the essence of design
                            problems and propose more impactful, user-centered solutions. These projects ultimately
                            shaped my understanding of the
                            PSSD landscape and reaffirmed my passion for creating meaningful and engaging experiences
                            through design.

                            value most about design. My primary contribution to a design group is to guide and deepen
                            the
                            discussion by providing questions and aiding in the formulation of where and what to learn

                            various stages of the project. Because this strategy facilitates the investigation of new

                            and the promotion of new solutions and a deeper understanding, team members may approach
                            challenges from a variety of perspectives. We may use strategic questioning to unlock the
